This is an additional specific instruction to set up your Coldcard with XPub. [The full instructions on how to set up the hardware wallet with Pocket can be found here](/learn/coldcard/set-up-coldcard)

Pocket is popular for recurring bitcoin purchases. Once you set up Pocket, you can reuse your payment details at will to receive bitcoin again into your desired wallet.

In this case, so that we don't always have to pay out your bitcoin to the same bitcoin address, we recommend that you share multiple bitcoin addresses with Pocket at once using your public extended key (XPub)

 This way you give less information about your wallet and behavior to the bitcoin network.

To do this, click on the option to share your entire wallet with Pocket.

To query your XPub, you can export your wallet on your Coldcard via `Advanced/Tools` -> `File Management` -> `Export Wallet`.

When exporting your wallet, select the `Generic JSON` option and next specify the same account number you used in your derivation path. Make sure that you create a separate account for Pocket. We recommend you to use the account number `1` here.

Once you have exported your XPub to the file `coldcard-export.json`, you can now copy the `xpub` from it to the Pocket website. Click on the `confirm` button.

With each bitcoin purchase, your bitcoin will now automatically land on a respective unused bitcoin address of your Coldcard wallet.
