This article serves as a guide for the initialization of the Ledger Model T / One via Pocket for the purchase of bitcoin.

The Trezor Model T / One are hardware wallets from the Czech company SatoshiLabs. With the hardware wallet you manage access to your bitcoin balance.

## 1. Requirement

In this article we assume that you already have a Trezor Model T / One and it is already set up.

## 2. Start synchronization with Pocket

Choose [buy bitcoin](/checkout) on the Pocket website. Click on the «Select Wallet» button.

On the next page, you need to specify where you want to store your bitcoin.

Now, to use your Trezor Model T / One, click the «Select» button in the «On your existing Bitcoin wallet» tile.

On the next page, you need to specify what type of wallet you have. Click on «Trezor».

In order to buy bitcoin without a user account and additional identification, the Trezor Model T / One sends a receiving address to Pocket. 

In addition, it also signs a message with the private key of this address (which, of course, remains secret), proving that the receiving address really belongs to this wallet.

To do this, Pocket's website communicates directly with Trezor Suite.

On the next page, click the Continue in «Trezor Bridge» button, which opens Trezor Bridge.
