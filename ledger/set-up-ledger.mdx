This article serves as a guide for the initialization of the Ledger Nano S / X via Pocket for the purchase of Bitcoin.

The Ledger Nano S / X are hardware wallets from the company Ledger. With the hardware wallet you manage access to your bitcoin balance.

## 1. Requirement

In this article we assume that you already have a Ledger Nano S / X and it is already set up.

## 2. Start synchronization with Pocket

Choose [buy bitcoin](/checkout) on the Pocket website. Click on the «Select Wallet» button.

![Screenshot of the Pocket website with the Select Wallet button](https://cdn.pocketbitcoin.com/DAFKWqAdn3o/fbbd9149-cb73-4840-8335-d8d3a032bce6.png?width=1024&height=768&placeholder=data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAQAAAADCAIAAAA7ljmRAAAACXBIWXMAAA7EAAAOxAGVKw4bAAAAMElEQVQImWMIZMicEDJhfsL0KoZEhmn5K7//+/Dn//8tHWsZZBiSYhnKCrRagxiiAV9tETPJbJAiAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC)

On the next page you need to specify where you want to store your bitcoin.

Now, to use your Ledger Nano S / X, click on the «Select» button in the «On your existing Bitcoin Wallet» tile.

On the next page, you need to specify what type of wallet you have. Click on «Ledger».

In order to buy bitcoin without a user account and additional identification, the Ledger Nano S / X sends a receiving address to Pocket. 

In addition, it also signs a message with the private key of this address (which, of course, remains secret), proving that the receiving address really belongs to this wallet.

To do this, Pocket's website communicates directly with Ledger Live.

On the next page, click the «Continue in Ledger Live» button, which will open Ledger Live.
